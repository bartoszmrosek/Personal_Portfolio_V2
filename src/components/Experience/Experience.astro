        During my final internship experience in school, I was working on
        improving my interpersonal skills as <i><u>First Line Support</u></i> for
        a big international company.
      </p>
      <p>
        My tasks involved providing IT support, troubleshooting network
        switches, and assisting applicants with the use of the <i
          ><u>English language</u></i
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks to this opportunity I quickly learned to find solutions while
        working with non-IT individuals and successfully tested my language
        skills in industry, despite initial challenges.

        During my internship, I had chance to gain practical experience and
        enhance my skills in the field of information technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of my most significant achievements during this internship was
        successfully <u><i>configuring UPS network modules</i></u> that were previously
        faulty. This led to a considerable improvement in the response time of the
        IT team, enabling them to address any problems that arose from remote offices
        promptly.
      </p>
      <p>
        As part of my role, I provided support to other team members and
        contributed to the refactoring of <u><i>legacy Javascript code</i></u>.
        This experience helped me to develop a deeper understanding of software
        development practices and the importance of collaboration in achieving
        successful outcomes.

        During my monthly internship, I had the opportunity to work alongside a
        talented team and contribute to the company's success.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of my most significant achievements was helping the team discover
        new functions of software that were being used throughout the company.
        These discoveries led to an <u><i>over 50% increase in efficiency</i></u
        >, and the team quickly matched the time efficiency of workers who had
        several years of experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to my work on the software side, <i
          ><u>I also found serious cybersecurity vulnerabilities</u></i
        > in the company's wireless network. I reported these vulnerabilities to
        the appropriate personnel and worked with the team to implement measures
        to improve the security of the company's network.
